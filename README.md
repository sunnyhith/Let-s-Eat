# About Let's Eat!
Let’s Eat is a web application to simplify the process of collaborating and scheduling group outings with your team or friends for lunch or dinner! 
We are unique in a way that we recommend restaurants based on the collaborative food interests and dietary restrictions of all the guests who have specified their interest in attending the event. 
We like to call ourselves Pandas 🐼. Being a member of “Let’s Eat!” panda community, you can either host new events or get invited by fellow pandas! You can also view or update an event you are hosting and even invite new people if you missed out on the first time.
