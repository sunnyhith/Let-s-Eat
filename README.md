### To launch in local

run `npm install` in both the `./source/LetsEat` and `./source/LetsEat/client` directories separately, which will install all the npm packages for server and client(React frontend) respectively.

Then run the following command from inside the `./source/LetsEat` directory.

`npm run dev`

This will start both the client (port 3000) and server (port 8080) and launch the site in port 3000.

### To deploy
Remember to build the project for production and serve the React static files from `/source/LetsEat/client/build`

Do these steps before deploying to Google Cloud Platform's Google App Engine

```
cd client

npm run build

cd ..

npm start

# deploy commands

```
